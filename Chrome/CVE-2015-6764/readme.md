[@oldfresher](https://twitter.com/oldfresher)'s exploit for his V8 bug [CVE-2015-6764](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=554946) is really awesome.I added  some comments for his code and tried to use Uint32Array instead of DoubleArray to construct fake ArrayBuffer object that will be abused for arbitary memory R/W.
