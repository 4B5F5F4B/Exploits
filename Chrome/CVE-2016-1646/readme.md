With the exploit tricks I learnt from [oldfresher](http://twitter.com/oldfresher) I tried to complete a proof-of-concept exploit for [CVE-2016-1646](http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2016/03/stable-channel-update_24.html), it has been tested on Win10 with  Chrome 46.0.2490.0 installed. You can try it your self like the following steps:
+ Step1: start chrome with "--no-sandbox"
+ Step2: browse the page exploit.html
